## Vulnerability Management Policy Draft Creation
During this phase, a boilerplate Vulnerability Management Policy was drafted up using ChatGPT using the following prompt:
```
Create a Vulnerability Management policy including sections on
Policy Overview, Scope, Responsibilities, Scan Schedule,
Remediation Schedule, Maintenance Plans, Non-Compliance Consequences,
Sign-Off, and Review and Revision. Include details for each section.
```
The policy was then slightly adjusted to fit the needs of the organization to create the initial draft. This initial draft will be used to identify capability gaps and gain buy-in from the stakeholders and other departments.

## Vulnerability Management Policy Buy-In
During this phase, the VM Program Manager will schedule meetings with all teams that will be affected by the new program and discuss the proposed VM Policy. During these meetings, awareness is spread about the program and the teams will have a chance provide feedback on the policy as it relates to their role and/or capability. For example, one department may feel the remediation cadence defined in the policy is too aggressive for their staff they have available.

## Vulnerability Management Policy Sign-Off
During this phase, feedback from the teams is taken into consideration, including adjustments to the scan and remediation cadence and non-compliance statements. Based on this feedback, a final draft of the policy is created. The final draft is then reviewed and signed off by the Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), and Chief Executive Officer (CEO).

## Server Team Meeting: Initial Discovery Scan
During this phase, meetings will be conducted with the relevant teams (server team, network team, etc.) to discuss the initial scanning of resources. These meetings provide an opportunity for the teams to raise any concerns and address potential issues related vulnerability scanning.
