## Vulnerability Management Policy Draft Creation
During this phase, a boilerplate Vulnerability Management Policy was drafted up using ChatGPT using the following prompt:
```
Create a Vulnerability Management policy including sections on Policy Overview, Scope, Responsibilities, Scan Schedule, Remediation Schedule, Maintenance Plans, Non-Compliance Consequences, Sign-Off, and Review and Revision. Include details for each section.
```
The policy was then slightly adjusted to fit the needs of the organization to create the initial draft. This initial draft will be used to identify capability gaps and gain buy-in from the stakeholders and other departments:
<details>
        <summary>Vulnerability Management Policy (DRAFT)</summary>
        
        1. Policy Overview
           This policy establishes the framework for managing vulnerabilities within LogN Pacific's IT infrastructure to ensure the security and integrity of our systems through timely and effective identification, evaluation, and remediation of threats.
        
        2. Scope
           This policy applies to all IT assets owned or operated by LogN Pacific, including networks, servers, endpoints, and associated applications.
        
        3. Responsibilities
           - Chief Information Security Officer (CISO): Oversight of the vulnerability management process and ensuring compliance with this policy.
           - Chief Information Officer (CIO): Ensuring that vulnerability management is integrated with LogN Pacific's overall IT strategy.
           - Department Heads: Responsible for ensuring compliance within their respective departments.
        
        4. Vulnerability Scan Schedule
           - Routine Scans: Conduct monthly scans of all IT assets to identify vulnerabilities.
           - Ad-Hoc Scans: Perform scans in response to significant security alerts or when new vulnerabilities are reported.
        
        5. Remediation Schedule and Cadence
           Based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):
           - Critical (CVSS 9.0-10): Remediate or mitigate within 48 hours.
           - High (CVSS 7.0-8.9): Remediate or mitigate within 7 days.
           - Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9): Remediate or mitigate within 30 days.
           - Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9): Remediate or mitigate within 90 days.
        
        6. Maintenance Plans
           - Routine Patching: Apply security patches and updates on a scheduled monthly basis.
           - Emergency Patching: Initiate within 24 hours for critical vulnerabilities that pose immediate risks.
           - Emergency Mitigation: Implement temporary measures (e.g., firewall rules, access restrictions) to protect against vulnerabilities while permanent solutions are developed.
           - Unpatchable Assets: Implement segmentation, increased monitoring, or phased removal from the environment.
        
        7. Non-Compliance Consequences
           Departments failing to comply with this policy will face:
           - Immediate review of their procedures.
           - Mandatory retraining for involved personnel.
           - Escalation to senior management for further disciplinary actions including termination.
        
        8. Sign-Off
