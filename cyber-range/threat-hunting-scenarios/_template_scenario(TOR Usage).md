# Scenario Construction Cheatsheet
**Detection of Unauthorized TOR Browser Installation and Use**

## Example Scenario:
Detect unauthorized use of TOR browsers within the corporate network, as TOR usage may indicate attempts to access the dark web, hide internet activity, or bypass network security controls. The exercise will aim to detect this behavior and analyze related security incidents.

## Steps the "Bad Actor" took Create Logs and IoCs:
1. Download the TOR browser installer: https://www.torproject.org/download/
2. Install it silently: ```tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.1.exe /S```
3. Opens the TOR browser from the folder on the desktop
4. Connect to TOR and browse a few sites.
   - Current Dread Forum: ```g66ol3eb5ujdckzqqfmjsbpdjufmjd5nsgdipvxmsh7rckzlhywlzlqd.onion```
   - Dark Markets Forum: ```g66ol3eb5ujdckzqqfmjsbpdjufmjd5nsgdipvxmsh7rckzlhywlzlqd.onion/d/DarkNetMarkets```
   - Current Elysium Market: ```elysiumyeudtha62s4oaowwm7ifmnunz3khs4sllhvinphfm4nirfcqd.onion```
6. Create a folder on your desktop called ```tor-shopping-list.txt`` and put a few fake (illicit) items in there
7. Delete the file.

## Detection Queries:
```kql
// Installer name == tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-(version).exe
// Detect the installer being downloaded
DeviceFileEvents
| where FileName startswith "tor"

// TOR Browser being silently installed
// Take note of two spaces before the /S (I don't know why)
DeviceProcessEvents
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.1.exe  /S"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, ProcessCommandLine

// TOR Browser or service was successfully installed and is present on the disk
DeviceFileEvents
| where FileName has_any ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe")
| project  Timestamp, DeviceName, RequestAccountName, ActionType, InitiatingProcessCommandLine

// TOR Browser or service was launched
DeviceProcessEvents
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any("tor.exe","firefox.exe")
| project  Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, ProcessCommandLine

// TOR Browser or service is being used and is actively creating network connections
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where InitiatingProcessFileName in~ ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe")
| where RemotePort in (9001, 9030, 9040, 9050, 9051, 9150)
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, InitiatingProcessFileName, RemoteIP, RemotePort, RemoteUrl
